Remote Sensing Image Jitter Detection and Compensation Using Convolutional Neural Network

This the code from the paper Remote Sensing Image Jitter Detection and Compensation Using Convolutional Neural Network

We use neural networks to correct the deformed remote sensing images.

Framework: python3.5 + tensorflow1.4 + keras the most latest version

Platform: Windows Spyder
